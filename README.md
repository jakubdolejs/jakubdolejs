### About me

Shortly after graduating with MFA from the [Academy of Art, Architecture and Design](https://www.umprum.cz/web/en/) in Prague I moved to Canada, where I lived until 2008. I'm now based in London, UK, where I run a small design company together with my wife [Sandra Friesen](https://sandrafriesen.com).

At about the turn of the millenium I began developing software, initially as an offshoot of my graphic design work. Since then I worked on a wide range of projects ranging from complex websites to consumer software to iPhone and Android SDKs.

Since the mid 2000s I've worked as a senior developer an systems architect at [Applied Recognition](https://www.appliedrecognition.com). Among other projects, I'm responsible for their flagship iOS and Android face recognition SDKs. I also contribute to the company's patent portfolio.

In addition to my software development work I maintain a successful [art practice](https://jakubdolejs.com) with gallery representation in Montreal and Toronto. I like to think that my art and design training gives me a unique perspective on the challenges of software development.
